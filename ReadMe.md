## Run application

To run the application locally, we need to install R 4.2.*. We can use the preferred IDE to run the application, although it is recommended using RStudio due to the simplicity of its use. With it, we can run the application just by clicking on Run App button while being in the ui.R  file. 

We can also run the application through the console. Fot this, we need to open an R console in the root of the project and then writing the following command: 

```bash
> runApp(".")
```

However, as users of the dashboard, it should be transparent the code and how to run it. For this reason, the dashboard can be found online through the following link: https://andreisaavedra.shinyapps.io/data-visualizationProject/
